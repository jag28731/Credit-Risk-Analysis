# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Project
Jill commended me for all my hard work. Piece by piece, I built up my skills in data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning. I am now ready to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, I will need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asked me to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

### Purpose
In this project, I used the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. I used a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

## Credit Risk Results
Below are the results after I evaluated the performance of BalancedRandomForestClassifer and EasyensembleClassifier:
